// Package listener provides generic functions which extend the capabilities of
// the http package. This is a fork of github.com/m-lab/go which is specially
// tailored for the needs of ndt7. I believe we will want to enhance the code at
// github.com/m-lab/go and make this code unnecessary.
//
// The code here eliminates an annoying race condition in net/http that prevents
// you from knowing when it is safe to connect to the server socket. For the
// functions in this package, the listening socket is fully estabished when the
// function returns, and it is safe to run an HTTP GET immediately.

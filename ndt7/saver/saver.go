// Package saver contains the code for saving results.
//
// Generally speaking, a ndt7 download or upload tests consists of two
// independent streams of data that need to be saved.
//
// During the download, there is a stream of Measurements performed by the
// server that contain TCPInfo and BBRInfo. For full duplex clients, we also
// have a stream of application-level measurements performed by the client
// that contain timestamps and number of received bytes.
//
// During the upload, there is a stream of Measurements performed by the
// server that contain TCPInfo, timestamps, and number of bytes that we
// have received so far. Clients implementing BBR or at least using Linux
// will additionally send us BBR and TCPInfo measurements.
//
// Thus, in both cases we need to have a functionality for zipping
// together the channel of measurements originating at the client and
// the channel originating at the server. This is the saver.

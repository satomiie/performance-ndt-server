All code in this directory tree is related to the support of the legacy NDT
protocol.  We have many extant clients that use this protocol, and we don't want
to leave them high and dry, but new clients are encouraged to use the services
provided by the ndt7 subtree. The test is streamlined, the client is easier to
write, and basically everything about it is better.

In this tree, we support existing clients, but we will be adding no new
functionality.
